<a name="createrecovertask"></a>
# **CreateRecoverTask**
> RestoreTask CreateRecoverTask (RecoverTaskRequest body)

Create a Restore Task for recovering VMs or instantly mounting volumes.

Returns the created Restore Task. This operation returns the following types of Restore Tasks: 1) A Restore Task that recovers VMs back to the original location or a new location. 2) A Restore Task that mounts the volumes of a Server (such as a VM or Physical Server) onto the specified target system. The Snapshots of the Server that contains the volumes that are mounted is determined by Array of Objects. The content of the Server is available from the mount point for the Granular Level Recovery (GLR) of application data. For example recovering Microsoft Exchange data using Kroll OntrackÂ® PowerControlsâ¢.  NOTE: Volumes are mounted \"instantly\" if the Snapshot is stored locally on the Cohesity Cluster. If the Snapshot is archival target, it will take longer because it must be retrieved.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using IO.Swagger.Api;
using IO.Swagger.Client;
using IO.Swagger.Model;

namespace Example
{
    public class CreateRecoverTaskExample

Get information about the logical volumes found in a VM.

All fields must be specified for this operation. To get values for these fields, invoke the GET /public/restore/objects operation. A specific Job Run is defined by the jobRunId, startedTimeUsecs, and attemptNumber fields.

            var attemptNumber = 789;  // long? | Specifies the number of the attempts made by the Job Run to capture a snapshot of the object. For example, if an snapshot is successfully captured after three attempts, this field equals 3. (optional)

            var jobId = 789;  // long? | Specifies the Job id for the Protection Job that is currently associated with the object. If the object was backed up on current Cohesity Cluster, this field contains the id for the Job that captured this backup object. If the object was backed up on a Primary Cluster and replicated to this Cohesity Cluster, a new Inactive Job is created, the object is now associated with new Inactive Job, and this field contains the id of the new Inactive Job.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **attemptNumber** | **long?**| Specifies the number of the attempts made by the Job Run to capture a snapshot of the object. For example, if an snapshot is successfully captured after three attempts, this field equals 3. | [optional] 
 **sourceId** | **long?**| Specifies the id of the VM object to search for volumes. | [optional] 
 **supportedVolumesOnly** | **bool?**| Specifies to return only supported volumes information. Unsupported volumes are not returned if this flag is set to true. Default is false. | [optional] 
 **jobId** | **long?**| Specifies the Job id for the Protection Job that is currently associated with the object. If the object was backed up on current Cohesity Cluster, this field contains the id for the Job that captured this backup object. If the object was backed up on a Primary Cluster and replicated to this Cohesity Cluster, a new Inactive Job is created, the object is now associated with new Inactive Job, and this field contains the id of the new Inactive Job. | [optional] 
 **clusterIncarnationId** | **long?**| Specifies the incarnation id of the Cohesity Cluster where the Job was created. An incarnation id is generated when a Cohesity Cluster is initially created. | [optional] 
 **startedTimeUsecs** | **long?**| Specifies the time when the Job Run starts capturing a snapshot. Specified as a Unix epoch Timestamp (in microseconds). | [optional] 
 **originalJobId** | **long?**| Specifies the id for the Protection Job that originally captured the snapshots of the original object. If the object was backed up on a Primary Cluster replicated to this Cohesity Cluster, and a new Inactive Job is created, this field still contains the id of the original Job and NOT the id of the new Inactive Job. This field is used in combination with the clusterId and clusterIncarnationId to uniquely identify a Job. | [optional] 
 **clusterId** | **long?**| Specifies the Cohesity Cluster id where the Job was created. | [optional] 
 **jobRunId** | **long?**| Specifies the id of the Job Run that captured the snapshot. | [optional]

# **SearchObjects**
> ObjectSearchResults SearchObjects (List<long?> jobIds = null, List<long?> viewBoxIds = null, List<string> environments = null, long? startIndex = null, List<string> operatingSystems = null, string application = null, long? ownerEntityId = null, string search = null, List<long?> registeredSourceIds = null, long? startTimeUsecs = null, long? endTimeUsecs = null, long? pageCount = null)

Find backup objects that match the specified search and filter criteria on the Cohesity Cluster.

If no search pattern or filter parameters are specified, all backup objects currently found on the Cohesity Cluster are returned. Only leaf objects that have been protected by a Job are returned such as VMs, Views and databases. Specify a search pattern or parameters to filter the results that are returned.  The term \"items\" below refers to leaf backup objects such as VMs, Views and databases.

            var startIndex = 789;  // long? | Specifies an index number that can be used to return subsets of items in multiple requests. Break up the items to return into multiple requests by setting pageCount and using startIndex to return a subsets of items. For example, set startIndex to 0 to get the first set of items for the first request. Increment startIndex by pageCount to get the next set of items for a next request. Continue until all items are returned and therefore the total number of returned items is equal to totalCount. (optional)
